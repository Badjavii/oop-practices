# Opp

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

There are many programming languages that use this paradigm. The most popular ones are Python, C++, and Java. For this practice, we will use Java.

## How to Install Java

To get started with Java, follow these steps:

- **Download Java Development Kit (JDK):** Visit the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and choose the appropriate version for your operating system.
- **Install JDK:** Follow the installation instructions provided on the download page.
- **Set Up Environment Variables:** Add the JDK bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
- **Verify Installation:** Open a terminal or command prompt and type `java -version` and `javac -version` to check if Java is installed correctly.

## Tools to Program in Java for Free

Here are some free Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) you can use to program in Java:

- **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition**: Visit the [download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and select the Community Edition.
    

- **Apache NetBeans**: Visit the [download page](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html).

- **Visual Studio Code with Java Extension Pack**: Visit the [download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the Java Extension Pack from the Extensions Marketplace.

- **Eclipse IDE**: Visit the [download page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

## What is Java?

Java is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its object-oriented design and platform independence. Created by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java enables developers to "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), ensuring compatibility across platforms without recompilation. Its syntax is influenced by C and C++, offering a secure and portable environment for building robust applications.
